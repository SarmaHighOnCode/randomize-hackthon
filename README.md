# ShadowIntern: Virtual Industry Simulation Engine

> *"This game is based on a true story. The names have been changed. The suffering has not."*

A narrative-driven web game that simulates the chaos of a corporate internship — from walking into the office on Day 1, to drowning in Jira tickets, Slack pings, and meetings that could've been emails. Built for the **Randomize Hackathon**.

---

## The Concept

**Problem Statement**: Students lack real-world exposure before entering jobs.
**Our Approach**: Instead of a dry simulation, we built a game. A darkly funny, increasingly frantic game.

You play as **[INTERN]** — no name, just a title — on your first day at **Nexus Corp**. The game unfolds in two phases:

### Phase 1: The 3D Experience (~3 min)
A narrative-driven first-person walkthrough inspired by *The Stanley Parable*, rendered in a retro pixelated aesthetic:

1. **The Street** — You arrive at the glass tower of Nexus Corp
2. **The Lobby** — The aggressively beige reception area
3. **The Interview** — Two interviewers who stopped feeling things around Q2 2019
4. **The Office Floor** — Open-plan despair with sticky notes and cold coffee
5. **The Desk** — The monitor begins to glow. You sit down. The real work begins.

### Phase 2: NexusOS 98 (~unlimited)
The game transitions into a fully interactive **Windows 98-style desktop simulation** where you must survive a workday by juggling:

- **ShadowJira** — Solve programming puzzles disguised as tickets (6 visual puzzle types + quick-fire text challenges)
- **QuickOutlook** — Read and triage incoming emails before they expire
- **NexusNet** — The company intranet browser
- **Slack Popups** — Random interruptions from coworkers
- **Meetings** — Mandatory time sinks that slow everything down
- **Terminal** — A working command-line with 12 commands

All while managing your **burnout meter**, maintaining **combo streaks**, leveling up through **XP**, unlocking **achievements**, and surviving **Boss Alerts** (close all non-work apps in 5 seconds or face consequences).

## Game Mechanics

### Puzzle Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Neural Network | Connect nodes to build a neural network path |
| Pattern Match | Identify and complete visual patterns |
| Node Connection | Wire up components in the correct order |
| Sorting | Arrange elements by priority/value |
| Logic Grid | Deduce correct cells in a logic grid |
| Pathfinding | Navigate through a maze/graph |
| Text Input | Quick-fire coding/trivia questions |

### Scoring System
- **Base points** per task completion
- **Combo multiplier** — complete tasks within 30s of each other (up to 5x)
- **XP & Levels** — earn XP, level up, unlock harder challenges
- **Achievements** — 10 milestones (First Task, Speed Demon, Combo Master, etc.)

### Stress Mechanics
- **Burnout meter** — rises from overwork, screen effects intensify (glitch, shake)
- **Boss Alert** — random event: close all non-work apps within 5 seconds
- **Meeting drain** — mandatory meetings steal your time and slow task completion
- **Email expiry** — unread emails expire and hurt your performance

### Keyboard Shortcuts
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl + 1-7` | Quick-launch desktop apps |
| `Escape` | Close active window |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
cd dev/frontend
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Opens at `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build

npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Environment Variables
Create `dev/frontend/.env` for optional AI features:
```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Performance Notes

- **Tick loop** throttles expensive operations (email/task expiry, array pruning) to 1/sec while keeping lightweight updates (clock, burnout, timers) at 60fps
- **Audio** uses a single shared `AudioContext` with procedural generation — no audio files to load
- **State** arrays are bounded and pruned (max 50 notifications, 20 completed tasks, etc.)
- **3D scenes** use optimized geometries and shared materials
- **Total repo size**: ~286 MB (under 500 MB budget)

## Production Deployment (Root Config)

This repository is pre-configured for automated deployment to Vercel and Render using root-level configurations that point to the `production/` directory.

- **Vercel**: Connect this repository to Vercel. It will automatically use the root `vercel.json` to build the `production/` folder and server from `production/dist`.
- **Render**: Connect the repository to Render. Use `npm run build` as the build command.
- **Manual Build**: Run `npm run build` at the root to build the production site.
- **itch.io**: Run `npm run zip-itch` to generate a ZIP file in `production/` for manual upload.

```bash
# Production Commands (from Root)
npm install         # Installs root helper
npm run install-prod # Installs production dependencies
npm run build        # Builds the project
npm run zip-itch     # Packages for itch.io
```
